    """Execute steps in a serial workflow.

    The workflow arguments are part of the execution context that is contained
    in the :class:`flowserv.controller.serial.workflow.result.RunResult`. The
    result object is used to maintain the results for executed workflow steps.

    Executes workflow steps in sequence. Terminates early if the execution
    of a workflow step returns a non-zero value. Uses the given worker
    factory to create workers for steps that are of class
    :class:`flowserv.model.workflow.step.ContainerStep`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    steps: list of flowserv.model.workflow.step.WorkflowStep
        Steps in the serial workflow that are executed in the given context.
    workers: flowserv.controller.worker.factory.WorkerFactory, default=None
        Factory for :class:`flowserv.model.workflow.step.ContainerStep` steps.
    rundir: str, default=None
        Working directory for all executed workflow steps.
    result: flowserv.controller.worker.result.RunResult
        Collector for results from executed workflow steps. Contains the context
        within which the workflow is executed.

    Returns
